# Autonomous-Delivery-Agent
autonomous-delivery-agent
An intelligent autonomous delivery agent that navigates 2D grid environments using various search algorithms to deliver packages efficiently while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles.

Project Overview
This project implements an autonomous delivery agent for CSA2001 - Fundamentals of AI and ML. The agent navigates a 2D grid city with varying terrain costs, static obstacles, and dynamic moving obstacles to deliver packages efficiently using multiple search algorithms.

Key Objectives:
Model complex grid environments with terrain costs and obstacles

Implement uninformed, informed, and local search algorithms

Handle dynamic obstacle avoidance with real-time replanning

Compare algorithm performance across different map sizes

Provide comprehensive experimental analysis
